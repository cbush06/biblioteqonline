# Scheduled Enhancements #

By version:
  * **1.1.1** Browse resources by type, creator/author, subject, and location.
  * **1.1.2** Allow use of custom logo and web site title.
  * **1.1.3** Add multilingual capabilities. Actual multilingual support is dependent upon volunteers to perform translation.
  * **1.1.4** Add "Librarian's Picks" scroller to the main page. This will add another info panel to the "My Summary" page's right column where cover images of items selected by the librarian will change every few seconds. This will be a nice way for the library to suggest new/popular items.
  * **1.1.5** Allow changing the color scheme. This will allow the RichFaces (TM) color scheme used by the site to be changed.
