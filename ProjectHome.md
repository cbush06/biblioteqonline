This is an Online Public Access Catalog for libraries. It interfaces with BiblioteQ, a desktop application that catalogs the assets of a library and manages their circulation. See:  http://biblioteq.sourceforge.net.

Technologies used in the development include: RedHat JBOSS AS7, JSF 2.0, RichFaces 4.0, Hibernate 4.1, PostgreSQL 9.1, and Lucene 3.6.0.

To download the software, please visit our [Public Folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1okhY2QTNMAWGpvLU5zQXp6YTA&usp=sharing) on Google Drive. You can find the already compiled EAR file for deployment, a zip file with the source code, a Word DOC with installation instructions, SQL Create Scripts to create additional tables required by the online application, and the JDBC 4 PostgreSQL Driver for your Java Application Server.
