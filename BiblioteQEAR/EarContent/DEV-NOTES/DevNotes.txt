#		VERSION NUMBERING SCHEME		#
#										#
#########################################

The numbering scheme employed by BiblioteQOnline uses 3 numbers separated by decimals (e.g. 1.1.1).

First Number: Indicates a major release of the software. This release either has broken backwards compatibility or has required extensive integration testing to ensure such
			  compatibility is maintained.
			  
Second Number: Indicates a new build releases. This is the culmination of exactly 10 enhancements, bug fixes, or additional features. Developer tests should be conducting on
			   all major components of the software to ensure no other features are affected by the changes.
			   
Third Number: Indicates the addition of a new enhancement, bug fix, or feature to the software. Developer testing should be performed on the component to ensure it functions
			  properly and does not adversely affect any related components.
